## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com) - React framework
- [Typescript](https://typescripttutorial.net)

### What I learned

1. I learned to set up a React project with typescript.
2. I gained familiarity with Typescript basics, including type annotations, interfaces and type aliases.
3. I learned to define and use generics for creating reusable and flexible components.
4. I improved my debugging skills using Typescript's type checking.
5. I understood the benefits of Typescript in ehnhancing code readablity and maintainabilty

```js
const [selectedOptionIndex, setSelectedOptionIndex] = useState < number > 0;

const handleOptionClick = (index: number): void => {
  setSelectedOptionIndex(index);
};
```

### Continued development

1. Deepen my understanding of advanced typescript features like generics, mapped types and utility types.
2. Investigate and implement more complex state management libraries such as Redux, Zustand, etc.
3. Focus on writing comprehensive tests using tools like jest and React Testing library.
4. Expand my knowledge to using Typescipt in a Node.js environment for full-stack Typescript applications.
5. Collaborate on open-source projects to gain experience with larger codebases and community-driven development.
